    <h1 id="myheader">Hello, World!</h1>
     <p>The world-wide-web is one of the most important technological innovations of the 20th century. What started out as a system to view and share documents has rapidly changed: Just in my lifetime, I can remember webpages that loaded line-by-line, and getting frustrated when my downloads were interrupted because someone called my house and knocked me offline. Now I, like most other people, carry a miniature computer in my pocket that's lightning fast, able to multitask, and exponentially more capable. As long as you have a smartphone and some service its nearly impossible to get lost, you can keep up with current events, find a new job, manage a business, stay in contact with every friend you've ever met, the list goes on. The web has become a powerful tool, an equalizing force enabling anyone to have the worlds knowledge at their fingertips - they just need to know how to ask.</p>
     <p>As for the future of the web, it can only continue to evolve and encroach into every aspect of life as we know it. Already, I can control my thermostat from my smartphone, and I receive email and text notifications whenever smoke is detected in my house. There is talk of refrigerators that keep track of what ingredients you have, when they expire, and potential recipes you can make with what you have on hand. Some people are justifiably skeptical of an increasingly ever-connected lifestyle, but the benefits so far outweigh the risks, and I see no sign of the momentum slowing. The more connected a device is, the more convenient it becomes and people more willing to accept the potential security flaws.</p>
